# Advent of Code

To run the code for a specific puzzle, use the following command:

```bash
python run_puzzle.py <year> <day> <part> [--toy]
```

To set up a new puzzle, use the following command:

```bash
python setup_puzzle.py <year> <day> <part>
```

For part 2 of the puzzle, we will automatically copy over the code, input, and test files from part 1 if part 2 files do not already exist.
